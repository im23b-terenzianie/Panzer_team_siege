# Panzer Team Siege

Panzer Team Siege is a Java project developed as part of a non-obligatory school subject. The focus of the project is on implementing artificial intelligence for tank bots, especially a custom bot that utilizes the A* pathfinding algorithm.

## Features

- **A* Algorithm Bot:** A custom bot that navigates efficiently using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
- **Multiple Tank Bots:** Various tank bots with unique behaviors and strategies.
- **AI Experimentation:** The project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with different AI algorithms and approaches in Java.

## Motivation

This project was created to explore artificial intelligence, pathfinding, and Java programming concepts in a school setting. It primarily demonstrates the implementation of advanced pathfinding and AI-driven behaviors for bots.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The entire codebase is written in Java.
- **A* Algorithm:** Used for intelligent movement and pathfinding within the simulation.
